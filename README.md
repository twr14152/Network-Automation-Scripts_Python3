# Network-Automation-Scripts using Python3
# Libraries: Pyeapi, Netmiko, Napalm, Telnetlib, Restconf, Nxapi, Nornir, Netconf
This repository holds various automation scripts I've written over the years. 
My goal has been to use this as a repository for knowledge retention as well knowledge sharing.
I plan to continue to grow this respository as long as I'm still doing stuff in the network automation space.

This has been a iterative learning process for me and I will be archiving or deleting scripts that no longer have value.

### DNAC
- Grabbing data out of DNAC
    - get_device_dnac.py
    - get_client_health_info.py

### Meraki
- Using requests to GET data from the meraki dashboard api (Orgs and Networks)
- Using requests POST to create a network through the meraki dashboard api
- Using requests PUT to update a SSID on a wireless device through the meraki dashboard api 

### Network Controller
- Playing around with Packet Tracer and testing out its network controller
- Grab network device info - network_controller/get_device_info.py
- Grab more generic info from network devices - network_controller/get_all_devices_info.py
- Update network devices (site wide) - network_controller/update_device_config.py

### Nornir - TestDrive 
- Cisco IOS - GNS3 lab - nornir/using_netmiko_plugin
- Arista Ceos lab - nornir/using_napalm_plugin 
- Testing newer version of Nornir, not backwards compatible with version 1.x

### Netconf
- Getting used to xmlns is a challenge and can be frustrating. Took me a while to find the proper xmlns to config a loopback
- Wrote a script to find out where that xmlns is in the server capabilities dump
    - netconf_svr_capability.py
    - netconf_svr_capability_ouput.txt
- Documentation around netconf is not intuitive from my point of view
- This will be a trial and error process. 
- Script to config loopback interface
    - netconf_config_device.py - configured a loopback on devnet router
    - netconf_config_device_output.text - results
- Script to do config backups. 
    - netconf_iosxe_cfg_bkup.py - rewrite of netconf_config_bkup.py
    - netconf_config_bkup.py - goes out pulls running config and places it in config_bkup/ directory
    - netconf_config_output.txt - the results of the script
- First time using netconf
  - netconf_ex1.py
  - netconf_get_conf.py

### Nxapi 
- Minor update to the  to make output from commands more readable 
  - added : print(json.dumps(response, indent=2, sort_keys=True))
  - added nxapi_script02.py and nxapi_script02_output.txt for comparison to original script
- Found this api documentation to be lacking
- Script examples I found were rigid and not very flexible
- Created a script to allow user to enter any commands (config/show) w/o having to rewrite the script.
  - nxapi_script_ex1.py

### Restconf 
- Created two scripts one to create an interface and the other to delete it
    - create_intf.py
    - delete_intf.py
    - script_output.txt
    
### Pyeapi - Python client for Arista eAPI 
 - Created some scripts for use with ceoslab in example_scripts folder
 - pyeapi_w_out_conf.py - using pyeapi without config file
 - Cleaning up directory archived some scripts and created interactive script folder
 - Posted configs and validation scripts for ceos demo
 - Posted configs and validation from demo
 - hidden host config file, needs to be located in ~/.eapi.conf
 - created two sample scripts

### Netmiko testing
- Got a request today to help someone write a script. Created folder and will keep the scripts in there. 
    - script_requests/req_config_script_07292020.py 
- Haven't messed around with Netmiko in quite a while decided to play around and try and update an old script to have both (show/conf) functionality.
- It's painfully slow as I haven't added any features such as MP to it to speed it up, but it was working with the devnet CSRs.
- Basically the script will ask the user if this is going to be a configuration or show commands script. Depending on the answer the script will do one or the other.  
  - test_stuff/interactive_script.py 
  - test_stuff/interactive_script_output.txt
- NetworkDiscovery/host_file_and_script/ has the most pragmatic scripts for doing network discovery (ie..scripts that run show commands and captures the results and saves them to files)
- Netmiko scripts for running show commands can be found in the NetworkDiscovery folder 
  - show_commands.py - easiest for every day troubleshooting and operations and lab work
- Python3.7 works with the scripts as written. Python3.8 is not yet ready. 
- Reorganized some config scripts into config_scripts folder
  - Scripts are self explanatory
- Created a script to go out and automatically determine the device_type for a host_list or seedfile.
  - NetworkDiscovery/host_file_and_script/auto_detect_script.py
- sample script to connect to juniper device
  - juniper_script1.py
  - juniper_conf_from_file.py
- scp 
  - file transfers to veos devices hosted using vagrant
  - file transfers to multiple devices using containerized eos or ceos 
- Network-Automation-Scripts_Python3/netmiko/NetworkDiscovery/host_file_and_script/
  - ios_discovery_enable_mode.py - if enable pw is required
  - ios_discovery_script.py - if username/password priv level 15
  - host_file.txt
- Added 3 examples of how to use jinja templates with netmiko
 - conf_bgp_r4_r5_using_class_obj. - uses class object to populate template
 - conf_bgp_r4_r5_using_dict.py - uses dictionaries to populate template
 - conf_bgp_yaml_jinja2.py - uses yaml files to populate a jinja2 template
- Created new script that provide you a sandbox to say how many devices, what devices, and what to configure on each
    - ssh_sandbox.py
- Created a very basic ssh script useful for discovery + updated with error handling
- Created script that can handle multiple device with multiple unique configuration files
- Added multiprocessing to speed up
    - netmiko_multi_dev_cfg.py
- Added multiprocessing Pools to scripts to speed them up
    - netmiko_script5.py
    - netmiko_show_cmds.py
    - netmiko speed comparison between serial and multi-processing pools
- netmiko_script#.py
- capture output of scripts

### Napalm for eos
- /config_scripts/conf_merge 
- /config_scripts
- Tested with ipython(python3.6) - EOS_lab_Napalm_test_results
- napalm_eos_script1.py

### Napalm for cisco ios
- napalm discovery script and post script
    - discovery_ios_svc_now.py
    - post_svc_now_rest_api.py
- created a config_scripts directory added new script
    - script_config_ios.py
- added new get_facts and get config script to directory
- Testing with python3 napalm_base and napalm_ios
- In my gns3 environment I'm using the following code
    - C7200-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M, Version 15.2(4)S7
    - IOS provides access to a subset of napalms features
    - EOS has been a more feature rich testbed with napalm

### Telnetlib module
- Added script that works with devices that require enable password
- Use python3 telnetlib module
- capture output of scripts

### Misc stuff
- script to find duplicate ips
  - findingDupIPs.py
- simple way to iterate through cli commands when running a script
  - loop_thru_cli_cmds.py
  - loop_thru_cli_cmds_output.txt
